# Battleship
This is a game called "Battleship". This is my first attempt at creating a game with java graphics.
This game was made according to the rules on this website: http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/
Ships can be placed vertically and horizontally:
*the user has to input a number, and from there the ship gets created towards the right (if horizontal), or downwards (if vertical)
